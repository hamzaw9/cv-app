# ðŸ“– CV App <a name="about-project"></a>

This is a simple CV application built with React + TypeScript. It includes sections to add and edit general information, education, and work experience. Some parts use React Hook Form for form handling, and React Query for managing async logic. Styling is done using Tailwind CSS, and the project is organized with reusable components and clean structure.
